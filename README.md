## Setup
You will need PhantomJS installed separately for this project to work.
* Download latest stable PhantomJS from [here](http://phantomjs.org/download.html)
* Selenium version `">= 3.0.0"`

**THAT'S IT!!** Because of latest stable GhostDriver being embedded in PhantomJS,
you shouldn't need anything else to get started.
